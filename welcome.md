- We use sticky notes!

### Data carpentry

This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for
working more effectively with data.

By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively
manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches
directly to their ongoing research.

### Spreadsheets

- intro about tidy data, link between semantics and syntax
- preparation for the task of programming with data, i.e data analysis

1. Data collection
2. Data preparation, cleaning, tidying, QC
3. Analysis: plotting, statistics
4. Interpretation
